            <p>
Work began on The Academy series in 2015 after the release of the Tara trilogy of games on vdategames.com. The first eight installments of the Academy were created and released over a period of about four years up until 2019.<br/><br/>
After a period of some uncertainty as to the whereabouts of the games' creator, it emerged that despite rumors of an untimely demise, work had never stopped on the series.
<br/><br/>
While completing on a further two episodes, a decision had also been taken to update the older episodes and bring them up to a consistent quality. At the same time, it was decided to release the new and remastered episodes on a custom-built platform.<br/><br/>
It also gave dsp3000 an opportunity to improve and expand upon elements of the story.
<br/><br/>
During 2022/2023 an ambitious schedule of release has been set.
